# Hackathon Rules
---
These are standard competition rules used for Forge Foundation Member Hackathons. Not all Forge Member Hackathons will use these rules as organizers can choose to use these or their own rules.

## The spirit of the competition
---
Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the hacker spirit by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

##  The rules of the competition
---
1. There is no maximum or minimum team size. If prizes are available, as a participant, you should make sure to check how many prizes are available per team and that they are divided evenly amongst members. There is usually a limited number of prizes for each challenge. So if you form a large team and win a challenge, there might not be enough prizes for everyone on your team.
1. Teams should be made up exclusively of registered activity participants who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the sponsoring event.
1. For in-person hackathons, all team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some time to hack elsewhere is fine. If the hackathon is remote at least one team member must be present at the sponsoring event to give contact information and collect the prize.
1. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and the world wide web.
1. All work on a project should be during the hackathon time period.
1. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
1. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
1. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
1. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
1. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
1. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. All submissions will be verified by git submissions time.
1. Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed.
1. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.

## Submission
---
Teams are to fork the https://github.com/forgeutah/Gowest2020-Hackathon repo and make a unique directory with their project. Once complete make a Pull Request to merge this into the master. All PRs must be submitted before 11:59pm on October 1st 2020. Include a README.md with directions on how to run the project. If necessary please include tests or example use cases that demonstrate how the project works. Feel free to use any programming language you are familiar with. 

## Judging Criteria
--
Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

		*Technology:* How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?
		*Design:* Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
		*Completion:* Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
		*Creativity:* Did the team stretch themselves? How did they address the problem space? 

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.
It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:
*How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down.
*How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.
*How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.
*How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!

So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Facebook. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing—but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.

## Remember!
--
The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends!
Happy Hacking from the GoWest team!
